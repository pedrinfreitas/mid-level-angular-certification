# Create a Component Driven by Inputs

# Challenge Description
In this challenge, let's create a movie item component that receives `Movie` information as an input.

## Requirements
- Open `src/movie-item/movie-item.component.ts`
- Add a required input of type `Movie` (see sample movie provided in `src/app.component.ts`)
- Update the provided HTML template to render the movie:
  - Title
  - Release date (no formatting needed)
  - Budget ($ {value} million - for instance: $ 50 million)
  - Duration ({value} min - for instance: 152 min)
- Update `src/app.component.html` to pass the sample `movie` as an input
- Ensure your component is displayed properly on the screen

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- Mini.css is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not required)

## Example of Finished Component

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
